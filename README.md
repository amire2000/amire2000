## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Amir



I have been working in robotics since 2020 , developing expertise in hardware and software for robotics systems, Currently I am focused on ROS2 base system.

    ðŸ§   I'm learning how to use rinforcment learning for control system
    ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on robot powerd by ROS2 with navigation and perception
    âš¡ Fact: Slow is smooth, smooth is fast, Writing clean, well-structured code prevents errors, making debugging and scaling easier in the long run.
    ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ROS2
